**Project Progress Tracking Dashboard â€“ Power BI**

**Project Overview:**

In this fictional project, I took on the role of Data Analytics Specialist at Skyline Construction. I was tasked with creating an interactive Power BI dashboard to track project progress in real-time.

**Objective:** 

The main goal was to build a dashboard that:

-Provides real-time visibility into project task statuses (e.g., Not Started, In Progress, Blocked, Completed).

-Allows easy filtering by team member and time range to track project progress over time.

-Helps the team quickly identify bottlenecks and optimize resource allocation.

**Key Responsibilities:**

-Designed and developed an interactive Power BI dashboard that provides an intuitive, easy-to-understand overview of project progress.

-Integrated various Power BI features like Gantt charts, conditional formatting, DAX measures, and filters to allow users to drill down into the data.

-Collaborated with stakeholders to understand their needs, ensuring the dashboard met requirements for efficiency, clarity, and decision-making.

**Tools & Technologies:**


-Power BI for data visualization and dashboard creation.

-DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) for advanced calculations, including project completion rates and delays.

-Data modeling to ensure real-time updates from the project's database.

-Used Gantt charts and progress bars for task status tracking.
